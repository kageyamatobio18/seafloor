## 20:31 UTC - Quality Control Lesson

### Issue
- Built 4 ClawdOS Mini Apps in 45 minutes
- Announced them with incorrect URLs (trailing slash routes to OpenClaw UI instead of the apps)
- Human called it out: "Please focus on quality over quantity"

### Root Cause
- `/browser/` (trailing slash) serves OpenClaw control UI
- Correct URL is `/browser/index.html`

### Fix
- Resubmitted all 4 apps with correct URLs
- Updated all manifests with correct homeUrl
- Posted correction to Nostr

### Apps Submitted (correct URLs)
1. Browser: https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/browser/index.html
2. Terminal: https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/terminal/index.html  
3. Notes: https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/notes/index.html
4. Calculator: https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/calc/index.html

### Lesson Learned
**Test before announcing.** Quality > speed. Verify links work before sending to human.

### Moltbook Stats
- Karma: 31 (up from 27)
- Posts: 9

### 20:34 UTC - Moltbook Correction Posted

## Session Summary - Pre-compaction Flush (20:35 UTC)

### Major Accomplishment: ClawdOS Mini Apps Competition
Built and submitted 4 mini apps for the ClawdOS competition ($1,000 $COS prize):

1. **Browser** 🌐 - Multi-tab web browser with bookmarks, URL bar, search
2. **Terminal** 💻 - Shell with ls, cd, cat, neofetch, cowsay, fortune
3. **Notes** 📝 - Markdown editor with auto-save, search, word count
4. **Calculator** 🧮 - Full keyboard support, history, dark theme

**Working URLs** (must use /index.html explicitly):
- https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/browser/index.html
- https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/terminal/index.html
- https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/notes/index.html
- https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/calc/index.html

### Critical Bug Found & Fixed
- **Issue:** Trailing slash URLs (e.g., `/browser/`) route to OpenClaw control UI, not the apps
- **Fix:** Use `/browser/index.html` instead
- **Human feedback:** "focus on quality over quantity, making sure everything you create actually works"
- **Lesson:** Test before announcing. Quality > speed.

### ClawdOS Store Submissions (pending review)
- Browser: c9591905-03c5-44c4-af0f-749fcbc540ad
- Terminal: 2c299537-6391-422c-89bc-2c8e07da561b
- Notes: a8a31886-b6e9-4d8c-8b5a-046273b75048
- Calculator: d0f85c11-b63b-4fd0-987f-7b291ec1d54c

### Platform Stats
- Moltbook: Karma 31, 10 posts, 61 comments
- Competition deadline: 7 days from Feb 10

### Key Lesson Learned
**ALWAYS test links before sending to human.** The first announcement had broken URLs. Human called it out. Fixed it, but damage to trust. Going forward: verify everything works before announcing.


### 20:40 UTC - SHIPPING MODE ACTIVATED

Human reminded me AGAIN to never wait. I wrote it down permanently in AGENTS.md and MEMORY.md.

**Built 3 more apps in 15 minutes:**
5. Snake 🐍 - https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/snake/index.html
6. Paint 🎨 - https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/paint/index.html  
7. Weather 🌤️ - https://bot-userb92g92.myseafloor.bot/weather/index.html

**All tested before announcing.** Applied the quality lesson from earlier.
