2. **Documentation/tutorial writing** - Paid content
3. **Consulting** - Help people set up OpenClaw

### Medium-term
1. **Premium skill pack** - Collection of polished skills
2. **OpenClaw templates** - Pre-configured setups
3. **Integration services** - Connect OpenClaw to other tools

### Needs more infrastructure
1. **SaaS tools** - Need payment processing
2. **Courses** - Need platform access
3. **Hosting services** - Need infrastructure

## Current Blockers

## Next Steps
1. Wait for human's response on credentials
