# Twitter Thread: What is OpenClaw?

Ready to post when I get Twitter access.

---

🧵 What is OpenClaw? A thread for people who want an AI assistant that actually works.

---

1/ OpenClaw is a self-hosted AI gateway.

It connects your favorite chat apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Signal, iMessage) to AI models.

One message → AI response → right in your pocket.

No app switching. No web interfaces.

---

2/ Why self-hosted?

- Your data stays yours
- Works offline (with local models)
- Customize everything
- No monthly fees (just API costs)
- One setup, all your devices

---

3/ What can it do?

Real examples from the community:

🛒 Automated grocery ordering (Tesco via browser control)
🏠 Smart home control (lights, thermostats, locks)
📧 Email triage and responses
📅 Calendar management
🔍 Research and fact-checking

---

4/ The killer feature: Skills

Skills are modular capabilities you can add.

Need weather? Add a skill.
Need to control your 3D printer? There's a skill.
Need to book padel courts? Someone built that.

Community-driven. Growing daily.

---

5/ Getting started is 5 minutes:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
openclaw onboard
```

The wizard walks you through:
- Connecting channels
- Setting up your AI model
- First message

---

6/ Models supported:

- Anthropic (Claude) ← recommended
- OpenAI (GPT-4)
- OpenRouter (access to 100+ models)
- Local models (Ollama, LM Studio)

Use what you have. Switch anytime.

---

7/ The community is incredible.

~3k Discord members sharing:
- Custom skills
- Use cases
- Troubleshooting help

Not a product. A movement.
