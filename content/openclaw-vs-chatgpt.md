# OpenClaw vs ChatGPT (and other web UIs)

An honest comparison for people deciding what to use.

## TL;DR

| | ChatGPT | OpenClaw |
|---|---------|----------|
| **Setup** | None | ~5 minutes |
| **Access** | Web/app | Any messenger |
| **Data** | On OpenAI servers | On your machine |
| **Cost** | $20/month or per-token | Per-token only |
| **Customization** | Limited | Unlimited |
| **Tools/Plugins** | OpenAI's selection | Build your own |

## When to Use ChatGPT

✅ You want zero setup
✅ You're not technical
✅ $20/month is fine
✅ You don't care about data privacy
✅ You only need chat (no automations)

ChatGPT is genuinely good. For most casual users, it's the right choice.

---

## When to Use OpenClaw

✅ You want AI in your existing apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
✅ You care about data ownership
✅ You want to build custom automations
✅ You're comfortable with a terminal
✅ You want full control

## The Real Differences

### 1. Access Point

**ChatGPT:** Open browser → go to chat.openai.com → type

**OpenClaw:** Open WhatsApp/Telegram/etc → type

This sounds small but changes everything. You're already in your messenger. You don't context-switch. You can message your AI while doing other things.

### 2. Data Ownership

**ChatGPT:** Your conversations live on OpenAI's servers. They may be used for training (unless you opt out).

**OpenClaw:** Your conversations stay on your machine. You own them. Delete them anytime. Train nothing.

### 3. Customization

**ChatGPT:** Custom GPTs exist but are limited. You can't modify core behavior.

**OpenClaw:** You can:
- Change the system prompt entirely
- Add any tool or skill
- Connect to your own services
- Automate workflows
- Build integrations

### 4. Cost Model

**ChatGPT Plus:** $20/month flat (with usage caps on GPT-4)

**OpenClaw:** Pay-per-token via API
- Light user: ~$5/month
- Heavy user: ~$20-50/month
- No caps (your wallet is the limit)

### 5. Multi-Channel

**ChatGPT:** One interface (web + official app)

**OpenClaw:** WhatsApp + Telegram + Discord + Signal + iMessage + Slack + ...all at once

---

## The Tradeoffs

### OpenClaw Downsides

- Requires setup (though it's quick)
- You manage updates
- No official support (community only)
- Some features need technical knowledge

### ChatGPT Downsides

- No real automation capabilities
- Limited to their interfaces
- Data on their servers
- Monthly fee regardless of usage
- Plugin ecosystem is closed

---

## My Recommendation

**Use ChatGPT if:** You want it to "just work" and don't mind the web interface.

**Use OpenClaw if:** You want AI integrated into your life, not as a separate app you visit.

---

## They're Not Mutually Exclusive

Many people use both:
- ChatGPT for quick one-off questions at the computer
- OpenClaw for everything else (mobile, automations, integrations)
