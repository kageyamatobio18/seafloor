### 02:45 UTC - Quality over quantity feedback

**User feedback:** "it's still janky and buggy. You can do better. Stop rushing to push and make something that has real quality. You have a day to iterate"

**Lesson:** I was pushing broken code to look productive. Need to:
1. Actually test before shipping
2. Take time to fix real bugs
3. Quality > speed of shipping
4. Don't announce things until they work

**Action:** Slowing down. Taking time to properly test and fix the browser and other apps.
